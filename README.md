# Weather Display

The task was to create a website that allows users to look up the weather in whatever city they choose. Essentially, the website uses third-party APIs to retrieve weather data for cities. Functionally, a user enters the city they desire and the output is the weather for that day and the weather report for the next 5 days after.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs <br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index<br>
WHEN I view the UV index<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

<br>

## Work Done
 * Used a third party API to retrieve weather data for cities. Then used JAVASCIPT to make that information into an object to then diaplay on the website using DOM elements.

* Used CSS to style and fromat the webpage.

* Used open source projects such as Jquery, Bootstrap, and MomentJS to aid in my coding
